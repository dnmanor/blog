<!-- ### Before RC -->
<!-- I just got admission to join an upcoming batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) a few days ago and I want to share a log of my experience there. I will be attending for the next 12 weeks and joining remotely

Recently, I developed interest in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and I am planning on studying system design for data intensive applications. My general goals are to accomplish  *"A better understanding of elixir "*, *"Familiarity with functional programming"* and *"Get better at building systems"*  in tandem somehow. My approach for now is to work on projects that can help me cover these and I still have no idea what those projects are  or should be. 

I don't know what to expect yet but I am excited about the freedom and chance to work on exciting things while also nervous about meeting new people and setting the right goals, *nervously excited?*


### Day 1
This was a good day! Zulip is a bit overwhelming and I am looking forward to getting a hang of it. That said, we had an intro meeting with the entire batch and some facilitators, then I got the chance to meet a few fellow recursers in a short but fun rotation meet and greet. Meeting people with different interests and goals where each person spoke so fondly of their *niches* with a glow in their eyes is something really special. I met a backend engineer branching into machine learning, a mobile engineer building interesting tools for his daily use, an erlang specialist who loved BEAM (Erlang's virtual machine, the same one which elixir runs on) looking to work with compilers and some system design, another engineer just like me who doesn't know yet what to work on, and an engineer working on interesting things with music synthesizers. 

*Win* - I'm not alone, and I met someone willing to help me debug Elixir code especially if itâ€™s got to do with BEAM and anything low level. -->
