# Fed Dog

Sometimes, I find myself pondering the most random things, leading to the occasional interesting observation. Here's one for you: in my city, encountering a stray dog is quite common. While there may not be specific statistics to back this up, the sheer likelihood of running into one suggests their numbers are higher than they probably should be. The reasons behind this phenomenon could be numerous, but that's not where my thoughts are headed at the moment.

There's a particular stray dog in my neighbourhood, coated with light brown fur and charming white spots. My acquaintance with her started when she was just a playful puppy. She'd often be seen on the main streets, joyfully chasing after people, especially the kids who frequented the outdoors – they absolutely adored her. Soon enough, this puppy became a regular sight, and I couldn't help but wonder why. Maybe she just enjoyed the company of the kids, but they were in school for the most part. During a short afternoon stroll, I noticed two bowls – one filled with water and the other, though empty, had stains of some sort of sauce. It struck me as odd, but I didn't dwell on it too much. However, on my way back, I spotted the same dog lingering around those bowls, and it all clicked! Someone had been feeding her with those bowls, and she returned to see if there was more. The next step was clear; having a dog myself, I went inside to fetch some of the feed I had.

This routine continued for a few weeks until I discovered that the initial idea to feed the dog came from the kids who played with her on the streets. It didn't take long for other neighbours to notice and join in, leaving food at that particular spot for her. Soon enough, almost the entire block was contributing, providing more food than she could handle. After a few weeks, she started bringing along other dogs, and before we knew it, they became regular faces too. Now, we have a neighbourhood filled with stray dogs that take turns guarding the area at night. They're not aggressive, but they effectively deter anyone with malicious intent.

The beauty of this observation lies in the impact of a single good deed or idea from the kids, setting off a clear ripple effect throughout the community. It leaves you wondering how even the actions we might consider small can have a profound influence on our lives and those around us. Another less conspicuous yet intriguing aspect is the conforming nature of people. The phrase "lead by example" took on a better meaning for me when I realized that the kids initiated a wave of empathy in the entire neighbourhood simply by being the first to show kindness to these dogs.

And so, the lesson unfolds – a testament to the power of small acts of kindness and the contagious nature of positivity.
