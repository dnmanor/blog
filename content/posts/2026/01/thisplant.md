# Why am I drawn to it?

Last year was a really interesting year for me. A lot of things went wrong, but a lot also went right. Chief among the things that went right was me starting a garden to take up some time in my day and take my mind off extremely difficult times. I started off quite casually, but just like any other hobby I start, I went all in and became very obsessive about its ins and outs. In the midst of this obsession, I found myself drawn to one particular plant. It was a small plant that bore simple white flowers and grew a bit like a bush.

I kept it really close to me and paid a lot of attention to it, figuring out its methods of propagation and growth just to be able to grow more of it. I found it fascinating, partly because it grew well unlike other plants I had in my garden that I struggled with initially.

Now to the why.

This plant blooms fresh flowers every single day. They wilt by the end of the day and it blooms fresh flowers the very next day without fail and by this point I can confirm it does so all year round. I love how I am met with its bright petals every morning that go to attend to them, it gave me a lot to look forward to. Additionally I choose to find that cycle resilient, albeit it might just be its nature. And I choose to find it admirable and wish to be able to apply that to my own life.
